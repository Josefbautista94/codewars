// 📂 Category: Fundamentals

// 📝 Description:
// You task is to implement an simple interpreter for the notorious esoteric language HQ9+ that will work for a single character input:
// If the input is 'H', return 'Hello World!'
// If the input is 'Q', return the input
// If the input is '9', return the full lyrics of 99 Bottles of Beer. It should be formatted like this:
// 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
// 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
// 97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
// ...
// ...
// ...
// 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
// 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
// Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
// No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
// Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
// For everything else, don't return anything (return null in C#, None in Rust, and "" in Haskell).
// (+ has no visible effects so we can safely ignore it.)


//
// 🧪 Examples:
// describe("Example tests", function(){
//   it("Example test cases", function(){ 
//     assert.strictEqual(HQ9('H'), 'Hello World!', '\'H\' should return \'Hello World!\'');
//     assert.strictEqual(HQ9('Q'), 'Q', '\'Q\' should return \'Q\'');
